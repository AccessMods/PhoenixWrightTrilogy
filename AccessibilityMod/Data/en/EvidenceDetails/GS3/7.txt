A grainy, black-and-white security camera still depicts a costumed individual standing in a hallway at night.

The subject is dressed in an elaborate costume featuring a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a feather and a circular emblem, along with a domino mask covering the eyes. The outfit includes a high-collared coat with heavy, fringed epaulettes on the shoulders, a braided leaf-like design running down the chest, and large, flared cuffs decorated with ring patterns. The figure is smiling confidentially.

The individual stands on a floor with a distinct diamond-plate texture, body angled slightly to the left. Tucked securely under their right arm (visible on the left side of the image) is a plain, light-colored rectangular box.

To the right of the figure, a large, dark, irregular puddle of liquid stains the floor, stretching towards the background. In the upper left corner, a digital timestamp reads "AM 00:58 43". The entire image is overlaid with horizontal scan lines and white corner brackets, simulating a viewfinder.
