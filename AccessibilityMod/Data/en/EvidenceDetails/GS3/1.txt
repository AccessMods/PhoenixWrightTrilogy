A monochromatic image depicts a man lying face-down on the pavement, situated directly beneath a severed, sparking electrical cable.

The man is the central figure, sprawled prone on the ground with his head positioned toward the right side of the frame. He wears a light-colored, long-sleeved jacket and dark trousers. His left arm extends outward along the ground with the hand relaxed and palm-down, while his right arm is obscured beneath his torso. His face is turned slightly outward, eyes closed, appearing unconscious or deceased.

Directly above the man's lower back, a thick, dark electrical cable hangs vertically from the top of the frame. The cable is severed, and jagged sparks emanate from its broken tip, hovering just inches above the man's clothing. To the left, a large cylindrical concrete utility pole stands vertically. Another segment of the cable hangs loosely in the upper right background.

To the immediate right of the man's head, a light-colored umbrella lies upside down on the ground, resting on its ribs. To the left, situated behind the utility pole, stands a small, roofed bulletin board structure near low hedges. The background features the facade of a large, multi-story building with rows of rectangular windows, stretching into the distance under a cloudy sky.
