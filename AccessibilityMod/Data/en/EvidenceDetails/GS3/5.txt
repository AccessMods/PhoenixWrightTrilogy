A promotional poster titled "Treasure Exhibition," featuring a large, reconstructed ceramic urn as its centerpiece.

The urn dominates the middle of the poster. It is a bulbous, light-colored vessel with a lid, and it appears to have been shattered and glued back together; a web of jagged cracks runs across its entire surface. Large, dark brushstrokes are painted across the front of the urn. Due to the specific way the shattered fragments have been reassembled, these brushstrokes clearly spell out the English letters "I", "A", and "M".

Text on the right side of the poster reads "The Sacred Urn" followed by "Kurain Village" in a larger, outlined font. In the bottom right corner, there is a distinct logo: a diamond shape containing the letters "LT," situated next to the brand name "Lordly Tailor."

On the left side of the poster, there is a small, circular inset photograph of a smiling young woman with dark hair styled in a topknot, wearing traditional acolyte robes and a necklace of large beads.
