A black-and-white close-up depicts a person's left hand tightly gripping a small glass medicine bottle.

The hand is pale and holds the bottle by its main body. The bottle contains several round pills which are visible through the glass. It is sealed with a standard screw-top lid. A label wrapped around the center of the bottle displays the word "coldkiller" in lowercase letters, printed over a large, bold letter "X" that is partially obscured by the fingers.

The person wears a dark, smooth long-sleeved jacket. On their left wrist, a wristwatch with a round face and a dark band is clearly visible. The watch face has simple tick marks for hours. The time indicated is roughly 03:05.
