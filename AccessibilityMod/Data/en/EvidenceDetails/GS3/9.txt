A costumed figure strikes a dramatic pose against a brick wall, illuminated by a split-lighting effect that casts green light on one side and pink light on the other.

The character wears a flamboyant outfit featuring a wide-brimmed green hat with two white feathers, a black domino mask covering the eyes, and a long green tailcoat with a high, flared white collar. A large, golden sun-shaped emblem with a stylized smiling face is pinned to the chest, appearing to anchor a yellow braided pattern running down the torso. A large green sack with a swirling, lighter green vine pattern is slung over the figure's left shoulder.

The figure's posture is dynamic. The right arm extends outward to the left of the frame with the white-gloved hand open and palm facing forward. The left hand grips the neck of the sack near the left shoulder. The background is a flat, uniform wall of reddish-brown bricks.

Significant colored lighting divides the figure vertically, altering the appearance of the white and metallic accessories. The right side of the body (viewer's left) is bathed in a yellow-green light, causing the right shoulder epaulette and the large, flared cuff on the extended arm to appear bright yellow. The left side of the body (viewer's right) is washed in a magenta light, causing the left shoulder epaulette and the cuff holding the sack to appear vivid pink.
