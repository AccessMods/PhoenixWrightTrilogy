A white, square sheet of paper features large handwritten text in the center and an inverted printed header at the bottom.

The paper bears distinct fold lines dividing it into quadrants. The texture appears slightly crumpled.

Two lines of thick, black handwritten characters occupy the center of the page, oriented upright for the viewer. The top line reads "2/21". The bottom line reads "SL-9".

At the bottom edge of the paper, the printed name "Goodman" and a horizontal line are visible. This text is upside down relative to the handwritten numbers, indicating the paper was rotated 180 degrees before the message was written.
