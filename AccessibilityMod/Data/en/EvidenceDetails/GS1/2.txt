[September 5, 9:27 AM]
Maya: Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.
Mia: Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.
Maya: Again? What is it this time?
===
Mia: It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.
Maya: Huh? It's not working? That's lame!
===
Mia: I had to take the clockwork out, sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.
Maya: Papers? Is that the evidence, then?
Mia: I'll leave that one up to your imagination. See you tonight at nine.
