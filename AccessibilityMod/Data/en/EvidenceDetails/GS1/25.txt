A bright, fluorescent blue stain resembling a smeared handprint appears against a dark red metal surface.

The stain is centered in the frame and glows with an intense, electric blue light that contrasts sharply with the background. The shape suggests a hand mark: two distinct, elongated finger marks point upward, while a third, smaller mark appears to the right. The main body of the print streaks downward, tapering off into a faded blue smudge, suggesting the hand slid down the surface.

The background is a uniform, deep red. On the far left edge, the dark, angular silhouette of a locker handle mechanism is visible. A small portion of a cylindrical hinge is visible on the far right edge.
