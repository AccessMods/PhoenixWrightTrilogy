A close-up view depicts the surface of a blue metal security locker door.

On the left side, a rectangular handle mechanism protrudes from the surface. The housing is a light metallic blue, framing a darker blue vertical panel. Inside this panel, a small, light blue square—resembling a sensor or button—is positioned near the top. A dark, angular recess runs vertically along the right side of the handle housing, serving as a grip.

The center of the image consists of a flat, featureless expanse of blue metal. Along the far right edge, a vertical cylindrical hinge runs the full height of the frame, segmented by horizontal rings at the joints.
