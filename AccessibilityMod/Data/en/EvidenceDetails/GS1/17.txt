A schematic overhead map depicts an L-shaped room or corridor featuring dark brown furniture blocks arranged along the walls of a beige floor plan.

The layout consists of a wide vertical section on the right and a horizontal section extending to the left from the bottom. The walls are outlined in thick dark brown, contrasting with the beige interior and the solid grey background surrounding the map. An opening in the wall on the far left edge indicates an entrance or exit.

Along the upper wall of the horizontal section, two distinct rectangular dark brown blocks are positioned with a space between them. These blocks appear to represent furniture such as lockers, shelves, or desks attached to the wall.

The right-hand wall of the vertical section is lined with similar rectangular blocks. One grouping sits in the top right corner, separated by a clear gap from a second grouping positioned lower down the wall. Another gap separates this lower block from the bottom right corner of the room. The remaining floor space in the center is open and unobstructed.
